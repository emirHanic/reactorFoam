# reactorFoam
Solver based on interFoam for 2 incompressible, isothermal immiscible fluids using a VOF     (volume of fluid) phase-fraction based interface capturing approach,     with optional mesh motion and mesh topology changes including adaptive     re-meshing.     The solver has option to calculate radiation decay of one of fluids.
